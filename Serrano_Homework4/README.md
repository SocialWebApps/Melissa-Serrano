##Complete Corrected File for Chapter 8 of Social Web Mining
###This .ipynb file can replace Chapter 8 - Mining the Semantically Marked-Up Web.ipynb
I updated all examples so that this can be easily replaced for when Dr. Shankar teaches this class again!

UPDATE: If you are having issues running this code, it may be because of your version of iPython. 
If this is the case, the github url should be appended to nbviewer.ipython.org/urls ie - http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github/SocialWebApps/Melissa-Serrano/blob/master/Serrano_Homework4/Homework4_Serrano.ipynb

Resolves to: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SocialWebApps/Melissa-Serrano/blob/master/Serrano_Homework4/Homework4_Serrano.ipynb
