UPDATE: If you are having issues running this code, it may be because of your version of iPython. 
If this is the case, the github url should be appended to nbviewer.ipython.org/urls ie - http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github/SocialWebApps/Melissa-Serrano/blob/master/FinalExam_Serrano/Serrano_FinalExam-CensusDataAnalysis.ipynb
